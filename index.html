				<h2>Hi, I'm Kim</h2>
				<span class="byline">and this is my life in a nutshell.</span>
			</div>
			<p>I grew up in a small town of Puerto Rico called "el Barrio Navarro", located in Gurabo, P.R. The younguest of three, one brother and one sister, I was always looking for something to do with my time. With no neighbors to play with, I had my garage full with 14 cats and a labrador. I think that's enough drama to handle. Raised by my mother, I live every day in the interest of making my life and my family's a better one.</p>

					<p class="date">Summer<b>2017</b></p>
					<h3><a href="https://www.akamai.com" target="_blank"> </a></h3>
					<p>As a Desktop Administrator Intern at Akamai Technologies under the supervision of Chris Breen, I joined the Helpdesk Team. More details to come as the summer goes under way!!</p>

					<h3><a href="https://www.capitalonelabs.com" target="_blank">Capital One Software Engineering Summit</a></h3>
					<p>During the month of April, Bryan Cole from the Campus Recruiting team of Capital One approached me with an offer to attend the May Software Engineering Summit. Today, I am more than grateful to have accepted. This one-week program that started on May 21st introduced me to more than I even thought I would learn. Apart from all the fun we had in the evenings after the workshops, this summit covered the topics of: iOS, Github Collaboration, Introduction to Bot Development, Machine Learning, Arduinos, Android Studio, AWS, Alexa Skill Development, UI Desing, Sketch, and Capital One's very own NESSIE API. After all of the workshops, came ... the Hackathon! During the hackathon me and my team made a bot for GroupMe that integrated the Nessie API, API.AI, Python2.7, Quandl, and other frameworks. Our bot actually won the hackathon and we got the chance to go home with <b>amazing</b> prizes (no spoilers). To learn more about this project, checkout my Personal Projects page.</p>

					<h3><a href="http://click.gs.com/aqvt" target="_blank">Goldman Sachs Engineering Essentials Program</a></h3>
					<p>As one of 52 college sophomores selected to attend the four days of hands-on workshops, I got the chance to see the work culture and the life of a Goldman Sachs engineer. I also received technical training on React and Nodejs, as well as on Javascript. Other technical skills taught were UML and BPMN modelling, services frameworks such as RESTful Services, HTTP, Java and APIs, as well as building user interfaces. As part of the program, I was given first-hand insight into the types of projects that engineers at Goldman Sachs work on, such as SecDB, Slang, Marcus by Goldman Sachs, and Marquee. I was also paired with a current engineer to be my mentor.</p>

					<h3><a href="https://www.qualcomm.com" target="_blank">Qualcomm Women's Collegiate Conference</a></h3>
					<p>As one of 60 undergraduate students selected to attend the conference in San Diego, CA, I gained technical knowledge of the Python programming language, Android Studio, and the Arduino. As part of the program, we also had a short-timed hackathon where me and my team, composed of three attendees and two middleschoolers, developed a pulse-sensored alarm designed for Police Officers when they are in distress. This device was wearable around the index finger, but could also be integrated in a glove. The purpose of this device was to call for help and alert authorities when a Police Officer is in danger or distress, but cannot physically access his phone, radio, or make a call.</p>

					<h3><a href="https://gs.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">GS Tech @ The School of General Studies, Columbia University</h3></a>
					<p>During the summer of 2016, I applied and interviewed for a Computer Programmer/Analyst position at GS Tech. A few weeks later, I was invited to join the awesome team at General Studies. Now, I am a member of this team that powers and keeps the staff of General Studies up to date and running. I implement kowledge base and document workflow for administrative forms and technical solutions to help make troubleshooting a standardized process; perform hardware and software installation procedures; troubleshoot and diagnose issues in equipment and software such as computers, printers, scanners, applications, and other peripherals using remote connections and direct interaction; create step-by-step solutions to common software and application problems for end users to follow. I am still part of this team to this day during the academic terms.</p>

					<h3><a href="http://www.intechxsp.com/en/" target="_blank">Integration Technologies Corp.</h3></a>
					<p>During the summer after my freshman year, I decided to take on a challenge: attend summer classes and have an internship. To my own surprise, I succeeded in doing both. I got my internship at Integration Technologies ("Intech" for short) as a Knowledge Management & Consulting Intern, while I was taking Calculus 3 and Calculus 4 classes. During my time at Intech, I developed SOPs for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and audited and updated configuration items on Intech's monitoring application (Spectrum) to match the existing database of devices.</p>

					<h3><a href="https://www.bioee.ee.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Bioelectronics Systems Laboratory</a></h3>
					<p>As a Laboratory Assistant under the supervision of Jeffrey Sherman, I was the only undergrad working at the lab. During my academic year at the laboratory I had the opportunity of implementing a storage solution to save space by storing multiple parts in the same space that was previously only used for a single part. This parts included resistors, capacitors, etc. My solution increased storage capacity by 70%. I also built a database in the wiki of the lab of these available parts and spare parts for all members to use.</p>
