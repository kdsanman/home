Raised by a single mother, I live every day in the interest of making my life and my family's a better one. My life is an opportunity I have decided to take on.</p>

                            As a Laboratory Assistant under the supervision of Jeffrey Sherman, I was the only undergraduate working at the lab. During my academic year working here, I had the opportunity of implementing a storage solution to save space by storing multiple parts in the same space that was previously only used for a single part. These parts included resistors, capacitors, chips, etc. My solution increased storage capacity by 70%. I also built a database in the lab wiki of the parts for all members of the lab to use.

To my own surprise, I succeeded in doing both. I got my internship at Integration Technologies (Intech) as a Knowledge Management &amp; Consulting Intern, while I was taking Calculus 3 and Calculus 4 classes. During my time at Intech, I developed SOPs for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and audited and updated configuration items on Intech's monitoring application (Spectrum) to match the existing database of devices.</p>

I implemented kowledge base and document workflow for administrative forms and technical solutions to help make troubleshooting a standardized process; performed hardware and software installation procedures; troubleshooted and diagnosed issues in equipment and software such as computers, printers, scanners, applications, and other peripherals using remote connections and direct interactions; created step-by-step solutions to common software and application problems for end users to follow. I was part of this team for the academic year of 2016-2017.</p>

As part of the program, we also participated in a hackathon where me and my team, composed of three attendees and two middleschoolers, developed a pulse-sensored alarm designed for Police Officers when they are in distress. This device was wearable around the index finger, but could also be integrated in a glove. The purpose of this device was to call for help and alert authorities when a Police Officer is in danger or distress, but cannot physically access his phone, radio, or make a call.

                        <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">As one of 52 college sophomores selected to attend the four days of hands-on workshops, I got the chance to see the work culture and the life of a Goldman Sachs engineer. I also received technical training on React and Nodejs, as well as on Javascript. Other technical skills taught were UML and BPMN modelling, services frameworks such as RESTful Services, HTTP, Java and APIs, as well as building user interfaces. As part of the program, I was given first-hand insight into the types of projects that engineers at Goldman Sachs work on, such as SecDB, Slang, Marcus by Goldman Sachs, and Marquee. I was also paired with a current engineer to be my mentor.<br><br>During the month of April, Bryan Cole from the Campus Recruiting team of Capital One approached me with an offer to attend the May Software Engineering Summit. Today, I am more than grateful to have accepted. This one-week program that started on May 21st introduced me to more than I even thought I would learn. Apart from all the fun we had in the evenings after the workshops, this summit covered the topics of: iOS, Github Collaboration, Introduction to Bot Development, Machine Learning, Arduinos, Android Studio, AWS, Alexa Skill Development, UI Desing, Sketch, and Capital One's very own NESSIE API. After all of the workshops, came ... the Hackathon! During the hackathon me and my team made a bot for GroupMe that integrated the Nessie API, API.AI, Python2.7, Quandl, and other frameworks. Our bot actually won the hackathon and we got the chance to go home with amazing prizes. To learn more about this project, checkout my Personal Projects page on Github!

                        <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Right after my Capital One Summit, I flew over to Cambridge, where I joined the Solution Center Team at Akamai Technologies. As a Solution Specialist Intern under the supervision of Chris Breen, I was able to experience what working for the greatest internet company feels like. During my time at Cambridge, I received training on what being a Solution Specialist means and how Solution Specialists are an integral part of Akamai. In this role, the customers were Akamai employees. As a Solution Specialist, I audited and corrected SOPs on the Akamai intranet pertaining troubleshooting software, installation of operating systems, and the configuration of hardware peripherals such as RAPs. Daily, I installed, configured, and troubleshooted software and hardware peripherals not limited to, but including personal video conferencing Cisco units, Remote Access Points, routers, ports, and different operating systems. I also had the chance of replacing physical components of Apple MacBook Pros and Lenovo ThinkPads. As part of my contribution to the team, I helped increase the Net Promoter by exceeding customer expectations daily and through the ownership and resolution of past trouble tickets. I also conducted new hire onboarding orientation for 20+ staff weekly, where new employees received training on connecting to the Akamai networks, got familiar with their operating system, and learned to protect sensitive data.</p>
